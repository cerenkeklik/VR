Summary
If we are going to talk about DiFinder briefly, it is a navigation application developed with VR support. In its basic structure, there are direction icons that appear when you look at the roads. Thus, you can follow the arrows and go to the desired location by just looking at the road. However, this application works well only for Akdeniz University campus. Thanks to future developments, the map can be expanded, and the application can gain functionalities for all of Antalya and even all of Turkey. The main purpose of the report is to act as a kind of user guide and to inform the user correctly about DiFinder. While the application was developed with VR support, its main purpose and target audience is the elderly who are not familiar with technology, people of all ages who cannot use the standard map feature due to charging or internet access, and everyone who wants to make their route more fun and energetic. In short, DiFinder is functional and open to anyone who wants to know and experience it. We think that DiFinder will be much more demanded than other navigation applications, and more importantly, it will be much more useful, especially if we consider the chaos experienced in the campus during the new registration periods, the time lost because people are constantly getting lost on our huge campus, and each of us being stopped many times to ask directions. Moreover, it is also fun to offer this service! We wanted to make life easier by developing this fun and easy-to-use application for all these problems we identified. We wanted you to experience the new experience we offer you and the simple view that the world will get thanks to DiFinder the moment you put on the virtual reality glasses. Therefore, our advice is to take advantage of this opportunity that we offer to all Akdeniz University family and experience DiFinder with the awareness that there is no complicated path in life, we do not just look at it from an eastern perspective. Even if you're not from the University family, don't worry, we targeted all of Antalya and then all of Turkey. You will hear the name of DiFinder everywhere as soon as possible, and you will witness how people are sure of themselves and the way they go with their VR glasses. Your quest for direction has never been this easy and fun, no doubt! Enjoy it.

Introduction

This report has been created as a guide to anyone who intends to use DiFinder or is curious about this technology. Considering the area it covers, 
DiFinder aims to be the most realistic and entertaining navigation application. Even though we want you to see how much convenience a virtual reality 
glasses with which we have integrated VR technology brings to your life, it will not be enough to describe it. Although it serves as a bridge to
transfer its functionality to textual expressions, we think it will not be enough. That's why we recommend everyone to get acquainted with DiFinder 
beforehand and have the opportunity to experience it.





Discussion
Even Google Maps, which has the most common use among today's technologies and is accessible all over the world, does not have a stable database and cannot 
provide accurate guidance if you do not have internet access. Moreover, assuming that you have some charging problems, since it shows functionality over the
phone and computer, it is not as useful as before for you. We wanted to improve this technology and make your life easier with new solutions by considering 
all possibilities for you. Our aim is to provide guidance without the need for any internet access. Although we are initially adding this to the Akdeniz 
University campus, it is possible to further improve this technology and increase its reach, and we aim for this.





Conclusions
As a result, DiFinder aims to be a part of our lives as a groundbreaking new technology in navigation applications. With the inclusion of virtual reality in our 
lives more and more every day, we think that this is possible. DiFinder aims to be the most user-friendly navigation technology ever developed. DiFinder must be 
experienced for this unique experience.
